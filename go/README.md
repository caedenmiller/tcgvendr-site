# /go/<name> — campaign redirects

One folder per channel/persona, each a redirect to the App Store campaign link. Instant in a real
browser; inside the Instagram / Facebook / Threads / TikTok in-app browsers (user agent sniffed) the
page shows an "Open in App Store" BUTTON instead, because those web views drop an automatic
navigation to apps.apple.com (blank page) but honor a user tap. No `<meta refresh>` for that reason
(App Store Connect → Analytics → Acquisition → Campaigns).

**TikTok is different (10-20):** TikTok refuses App Store links from personal accounts even on a tap ("Action can't be completed", policy since 2023). `/escape.js`, loaded on every site page and every /go page, catches App Store taps inside TikTok on iPhone and LOADS /go/tiktok/, which opens with the sheet up (⋯ then Open in browser, or search the App Store). Open in browser hands Safari that page, which redirects to the store (ct=tiktok). Failed on Caeden's phone 10-20: x-safari-https (no jump) and history.replaceState (TikTok opens the last LOADED address). The bio stays tcgvendr.com (Caeden's ruling). `/go/tt-test/` = the on-device test page (six ways out, labelled A to F). The bio holds the short address;
the campaign token lives here, so a token change never touches a bio.

**10-25:** site pages inside TikTok (iPhone) now pin a bar on load: "To get the app, tap ⋯ then Open in browser" with an arrow at TikTok's ⋯ (escape.js v7). 29 of 37 visits after the viral post never tapped a store button, so the tap-only sheet never reached them.

**MAYBE (not built, his 10-25 call):** cut the second "Get the app" tap in Safari. Inside TikTok, the homepage reloads itself once as `/?tt=1` (a real load, so TikTok's Open in browser hands Safari that address); in Safari (not TikTok) `?tt=1` redirects straight to the App Store. Risk: TikTok blocked the real navigation to /go/tiktok/ for normal visitors (grey "Open this link in your browser" screen, his brother's phone 10-21), and it is unknown whether that was the page or the navigation. Test on a phone that is NOT his (the account owner is never blocked) before shipping.

| path | campaign (ct=) | used in |
|---|---|---|
| /go/maya | ugc-maya | @maya.collects Instagram bio (TikTok bio points at the Instagram until 1,000 followers) |
| /go/tiktok | tiktok | the Safari landing for the TikTok escape (not a bio link; the bio stays tcgvendr.com) |
| /go/reddit | reddit | u/C333343 Reddit profile. Per-subreddit splits, if ever wanted, follow as /go/reddit-<sub> with ct=reddit-<sub>, leaving plain `reddit` as the profile/catch-all. |


**Android (10-21):** these pages hide the badge on Android ("iPhone only right now"); `/android.js` (loaded on every page and in gen.py's template) adds a "Tell me when it's on Android" button that opens the waitlist sheet. On the homepage it relabels the App Store buttons "On Android? Get notified". See data-model.md "Android waitlist".

**Regenerate** after editing the template or re-baking the tables: `python3 go/gen.py maya ugc-maya && python3 go/gen.py reddit reddit`.
The strip at the top reads `data/tables.json` (cards on tables at upcoming shows), the same bake as the landing page's "Cards waiting at upcoming shows" strip (scripts/website-tables.py). Tiles from shows that have ended drop out on their own while three or more are still upcoming; with fewer, the ended ones stay (without their show line) so the strip never empties.
